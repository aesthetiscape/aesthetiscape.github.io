        <h2 class="card tab" id="summons">Generating NPCs</h2>
        <div class="card tabbed">
            <p>Both the GM and players may have reason to generate NPCs. Any character with a stat block is genrated this way.</p>
            <div class="flex-container">
                <p>First, determine the <a href="./glossary-terms.html#soul_value">Soul Value</a> of the NPC. For characters generated as a result of a spell or miracle, the Soul Value should be explicit in the effect description. For spells, created by a player (at higher levels), the player should discuss with the GM the Soul Value according to Psyche and Stamina spent. For other characters, Soul Value is up to the GM's discretion.</p>
                <p>For NPCs, each Characteristic is equal to the sum of the Soul Value's number of d6, and each Characteristic is rolled seperately. NPCs generally do not have Capabilities, but in the case that they do, they are generated the same way the player character Capabilities are generated.</p>
                <p>The following is an example:<br>
                <sub>Lesser Demon | Soul Value: 5d6<br>Vitality: 24<br>Stamina: 19<br>Psyche: 10</sub></p>
            </div>

        <!-- <h2 class="card tab" id="enemies">Enemies</h2>
        <div class="card tabbed">
            <p>Below is a list of ideas for monsters and other antagonistc characters with special abilities. These enemies are classified according to a star system: 3, 4 or 5 stars.</p>
            <div class="flex-container">
                <p>*** (3 stars)</p>
                    <p>Hunter<br> An enemy that will follow the party without engaging them directly, but will call enemies to them from the Underworld. The party must either put up with the increase in enemies or stop and find the Hunter.<br> If the party is travelling while followed by a Hunter, they will be attacked in the night by a group of 1d6 enemies until they stop the Hunter or are able to successfully cover their trail.</p>
                <p>**** (4 stars)</p>
                    <p>Feeder<br> An interdimensional parasitic entity which feeds on the mind as it is restored, and over the course of days it will eventually consume the mind of its victim.<br> Each day, reduce Psyche regained while resting by 1d3. When this effect takes place, start a counter to keep track of the days since the first occurence. <br>After a number of days equal to the affected character's Psyche score plus one, reduce Psyche score by one.<br> If Psyche is reduced to zero in this way, the character becomes a vessel for the Feeder and will attempt to establish a new connection with another party member.</p>
                <p>***** (5 stars)</p>
                    <p>The Shadow of Many Names<br> Known by the Ghasahrans as Alqadim, The Old One, because its beginning is not known. Known by the Terrasantans as Denbora Mugatua, The Timebound, because it is not constrained to space. Known by the Rawageni as Sing Tanpa Wujud, The Shapeless, because it has no form.<br> An evil found across the world, it has been forgotten, is feared, and is yet to be known.<br> The Shadow of Many Names is an elder demon tied to lunar cycles. During a lunar eclipse, it is at the height of its spiritual power, and during a solar eclipse it reaches the height of its physical power.<br> At lunar eclipses, it will assault the party with nonphysical effects, and at solar eclipses it will assault the party with physical effects.</p>
