        <h2 class="card tab" id="description">The Underworld</h2>
        <div class="card tabbed">
            <p>The Underworld is the place where all dead things are collected. It is a decaying and rotten place, filled with the muck of millenia of detritus; a vast waste of grey slime with no horizon as far as can be perceived. All living things: plants, animals and people, enter the Underworld upon death to contribute their bodies to the mire.</p>
            <p>Upon death, the conscious "awakens" in the Underworld, and is slowly consumed by it. People clinging to humanity band together for survival, forming tribes and villages, but each one inevitably turns on itself, and these villages of the dead become pits of despair where the wildest survive.</p>
            <p>Those who are not consumed become shadows of their former selves, driven further and further into wickedness through their insanity, and are eventually wholly consumed to become slaves and fodder for the demons that live in the waste.</p>
            <p>However, it is possible to leave the Underworld after death and to return to the Land of the Living.</p>
        </div>

        <h2 class="card tab" id="arrival">Arrival</h2>
        <div class="card tabbed">
            <p>Players whose health is reduced to zero are sent to the Underworld. Once in the Underworld, a character that has died must either escape or lose their character forever to the Land of the Dead.</p>
            <p>The only other way of entering the Underworld is through one of the Spirit Gates, hidden throughout the Overworld. However, these gates are dangerous, and are guarded by powerful demons.</p>
        </div>

        <h2 class="card tab" id="escape">Escape</h2>
        <div class="card tabbed">
            <p>If a character entered the Underworld by dying, then their means of escape is as follows.</p>
            <p>The dead player must roll a series of 3 checks:<br>One Difficult (-2)<br>One Very Hard (-4)<br>One Formidable (-6)</p>
            <p>Each check is made with one Stat modifier, and each Stat modifier may only be used for one check.</p>
            <p>Stat modifiers are the only modifiers able to be applied to these checks, and the Player chooses which Stat modifier is used for which check.</p>
            <p>A failure on any of the three checks means that character is unable to escape the Underworld and is lost forever.</p>
            <p>If a player wishes, instead of rolling the check, they may take a reduction to the Stat modifier that would be used for the check. This reduction is equal to the check difficulty multiplied by two:<br>Difficult = 4 point reduction<br>Very Hard = 8 point reduction<br>Formidable = 12 point reduction</p>
            <p>A Stat cannot be reduced in this way if it is lower than the amount it would be reduced by.</p>
            <p>Keep in mind that this reduction will require a player to recalculate their Capabilities and change the modifiers for both the Stat and its Capabilities.</p>
            <p class="editor-note">! work in progress !</p>
            <p style="display:none;">
                How should players be able to escape? 
                    ? a series of 3 rolls of increasing DC, one for each stat. Players can choose which stat to use for which roll ?
                    ? can players choose to permanently expend/lose something to get a bonus or automatically succeed on a roll ?

                ? permanent addition to characters that revive from the dead ?
                    less likely to be detected by mortals and the living, but more likely to be detected by demons and undead.
