            <h3>Characteristics</h3>
            <p>Characteristics dictate general strengths and weaknesses when interacting with the world. The maximum score for each Characteristic is 20.</p>
            <p>There are 3 Characteristics: Vitality, Stamina and Psyche. Each Characteristic is generated by rolling 3d6 and dropping the lowest die. If the result is 2, players may choose to re-roll the dice for that Characteristic.</p>
            <p>Players may choose to roll the totals for all of their Characteristics and then assign them to create whatever character profile they desire, or may assign them in the order they are rolled and allow the dice to decide their specialty.</p>
                
            <section>
                <div class="vitality"><h4>Vitality</h4> 
                        <p>A character's hardiness. </p>
                        <p>Vitality contributes directly to a character's pool of health points, as well as indirectly providing resistance to both physical and nonphysical attacks.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="stamina"><h4>Stamina</h4>
                        <p>A character's prowess.</p>
                        <p>All actions during combat, whether it be movement, weapon attacks, or casting spells, require Stamina.</p>

                <div class="psyche"><h4>Psyche</h4>
                        <p>A character's fortitude.</p>
                        <p>All spells require Psyche to cast, but characters may also find other uses for Psyche, such as imbuing weapons strikes with magical effects, or using certain items.</p>

            <h3>Capabilities</h3>
                <p>Capabilities provide more fine tuning for their talents and skills. Each Capability is influenced directly by a corresponding Characteristic. The maximum score for Capabilities is 20.</p>
                <p>Capabilities are generated by allocating the total value of a Characteristic between the two Capabilities connected to it, indicated by the first letter of the corresponding Characteristic.</p>

                        <p>At character creation and at every level up, the player will roll 1d6, which is then added to their character's Health Bonus.</p>
                        <p>A character's Health Bonus is cumulative: Whenever Vitality or health bonus is increased, this is to help players easily recalculate their Health when it changes.</p>

                        <p>Coin is the currency in traditional monetary transactions, however players may find that many merchants may be open to non-traditional payment.</p>
