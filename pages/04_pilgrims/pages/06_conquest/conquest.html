                    <h4>The Buy</h4>
                    <p>In order to play, players must place their Buy into the Pot. The Buy may be different depending on who or where the game is played. High stakes Conquest may happen in castles among nobles, or between proud and affluent ship captains in some of the larger ports. Low stakes Conquest is more common, and can be found in most taverns or ports, and often friends. Additionally, the Buy may consist of things other than Coin, such as a desired good, a promised service, or some other non-monetary trade, but the players must agree on the value of the Buy.</p>

                    <h4>The Deal</h4>
                    <p>Each player is dealt a number of soldiers equal to the number of players +1.</p>
                </span>
                <span>
                    <h4>The Round</h4>
                    <p>1. Each player who doesn't have a Commander draws one Commander.</p>
                    <p>2. Each player plays a Soldier, face down, from their hand onto the field.</p>
                    <p>3. Once all players have a Soldier on the field, all Soldiers are revealed.</p>
                    <p>4. The highest value Soldier on the field wins the hand, ties are determined by suit.</p>
                    <p>5. Commanders may now be played in turn order, clockwise from the dealer.</p>
                    <p>6. After all Commanders are resolved and the hand won, the next round begins.</p>
